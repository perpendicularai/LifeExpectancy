# LifeExpectancy
This is a jupyter notebook inspired by the book "Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-learn, Keras and Tensorflow" machine learning guide. It is an end-to-end example of creating a machine learning model to predict the value of a particular feature. The book can be downloaded from Google Play Books. Alternatively, you may download the jupyter notebook that has been included in the repo under the notebooks directory. The dataset can be found in the data directory. Have fun and enjoy!
